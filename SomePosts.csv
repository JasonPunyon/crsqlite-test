19,,"What is the fastest way to get the value of π?","<p>I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of π, as a personal challenge. More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code> constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<p>AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection which means that dereferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collecting languages (like C# and Java as well).</p>
<p>Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by <code>byteArray</code> or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where <code>byteArray</code> is declared.</p>
<p>You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing. If you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help it.</p>
<p>To force a GC, try (yes, twice):</p>
<pre><code>flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();

<p>I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of ""Monte-Carlo"" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes.</p>

<p>Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)</p>

<p>Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact.</p>

<p>Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.</p>

<p>Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. </p>

<p>This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods.</p>

<p>A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would &quot;include_once&quot; into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE &quot;hooks.php&quot; file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low.

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQL&nbsp; Server</a>. The main part I need to be decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

Is the problem occurring on Vista native or SP 1?</p>
"
112,104,,"<p>The best explanation I've seen is in Chapter 7 of the free <a href=""http://codebetter.com/karlseguin/2008/06/25/foundations-of-programming-ebook/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Foundations of Programming e-book</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, in <strong>.NET</strong> a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.</p>

<p>You'll know that you have leaks when you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (<strong>PerfMon</strong> has nice memory counters). </p>

<p>Understanding <strong>.NET</strong>'s memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work — again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the e-book. Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object <strong>A</strong> is registered to an event on object <strong>B</strong>, then object <strong>A</strong> will stick around until object <strong>B</strong> disappears because <strong>B</strong> holds a reference to <strong>A</strong>. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. </p>

<p>Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (<a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/index.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">red-gate ants profile</a>, JetBrains dotMemory, <a href=""http://memprofiler.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">memprofiler</a> are really good choices, or you can use the text-only <strong>WinDbg</strong> and <strong>SOS</strong>, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).</p>

<p>I believe unmanaged code is subject to its typical memory leaks, except that shared references are managed by the garbage collector. I could be wrong about this last point.</p>

<p>I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>String property = this.property;
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;property;

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;getProperty();

<p>Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>
"
127,126,,"<p>This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if you're using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that <em>needs</em> to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called).</p>
"
128,126,,"<p>It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.</p>

<p>Now let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count.</p>

<p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p>

<p>However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data, I typically do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()

taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
